# Robust Fiber Composite Linkage

This repository is digital workflow used to create a model that predicts the effective stiffness of composite microstructures. The [ipython notebook](https://github.com/materials-challenge/fiber_submission/blob/master/robust_fiber_linkage.ipynb) reproduces a figure that compares different models. 

## Requirements

In order to run this workflow you need to have the following Python Packages in addition to the packages needed to run ipython notebook.

 - [PyMKS](http://materialsinnovation.github.io/pymks/rst/INSTALLATION.html)
 - [Sfepy](http://sfepy.org/doc-devel/installation.html)
